  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - assets/dummy_img/
    - assets/lang_icons/
    - assets/badges/HardBadges/
    - assets/badges/EasyBadges/
    - assets/badges/MediumBadges/
    - assets/badges/StreakBadges/
    - assets/badges/DSBadges/
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Inter
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter_18pt-LightItalic.ttf
           style: italic
         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter_18pt-SemiBold.ttf
           weight: 600
         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter_24pt-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter_18pt-Black.ttf
           weight: 800
         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter_28pt-Regular.ttf
           weight: 300
         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter_28pt-LightItalic.ttf
           style: italic
           weight: 200
         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter_24pt-Thin.ttf
           weight: 100

#         - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
